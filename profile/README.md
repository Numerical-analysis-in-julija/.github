# Numerical analysis in Julija 
In this organization, you can find the code for problems I solved for the Numerical Mathematics course. The code is written in Julia, and the tasks are provided here link to the [Assignments](https://nummat.gitlab.io/vaje-nummat/contributing/). For a deeper understanding of numerical mathematics, you can check out this [YouTube video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOR31yN43Kg&list=PLDea8VeK4MUTOBXLpvx_WKtVrMkojEh52).
